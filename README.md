# MIDI Cross

Retransmit MIDI messages to multi MIDI ports.

## Usage

This GUI program should be simple to use and the UI is designed to be user-friendly. Just read the description of each release to learn more.

## Using Library & Frame

RtMidi

Qt 5.15.1

## Platform

Target Platform: Win32 (default)

Compiler: MinGW32

Change the definition in RtMidi.h and the libs in MIDICrossGUI.pro to switch to other target platforms.

Both Qt and RtMidi support multi platforms, and there is no windows API used in the codes. Thus it will be easy to switch the target platform to Mac OSX or Linux.
